# Cross-platform UTF8
Cross-platform globally shared text.

The purpose of this library is to provide a starting point to make the [ICU4x library](http://blog.unicode.org/2022/09/announcing-icu4x-10.html) -- a new Rust implementation of the International Components for Unicode -- available in .Net.

We specifically want to use UTF8 in a consistently-sortable manner on all platforms.

Windows, Linux & Mac (x64 & ARM) binaries are made available through this library, for wrapping in .Net.
